# HackSC 2020 Skypark
Skypark is a program that is built with the edgeIQ API from alwaysAI.

What is Skypark:
Skypark is a real-time object detector that uses pre-trained computer vision models to calculate the number of parking spaces that are available in between x number of cars. The program can be run on a Raspberry Pi 4 and the video feed can be from a Pi 4 camera. 

Skypark was the HackSC 2020 project with team members:
Skylar Kim, Hung Tam, Kris Tanhueco, Katrina Ngo

I served as the main programmer and did the main set up of the hardware and software.
Later in the process, Hung Tam and I figured out the logic and used the edgeIQ API to calculate the number of parking spaces that are available in between the cars.

Thank you to the alwaysAI team for helping us with this project and providing us with the hardware!
